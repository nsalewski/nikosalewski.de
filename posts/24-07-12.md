Hey. I had a really good week and it feels good having that in mind on a Friday evening. I don't have a clear head at this moment because of some stuff, but of course, I wanted to write a few words.

I just watched the first minutes of an interview with [GM Vishnu Prasanna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHUfb4_ZyoM) who is the coach of Gukesh. So inspiring and insightful.

I broke my sleeping rhythm this evening by staying up late. That's okay, I guess. I want to stick to going to bed early (around 10 pm) but there have to be exceptions.

I will go to bed now. I hope you're doing good. See you tomorrow!
