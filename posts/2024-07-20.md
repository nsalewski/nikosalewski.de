Today was _Build Day_ in _CoCoDue_! I finished a lot of tasks in the seven hours. Now we have a dynamic header that adjusts to different roles and we have a semi-functional teacher dashboard with which the teachers can design their profile. It's quite a toy already, but I still need to add the backend functionality.

I listened to music, got some ice cream and spent a nice summer day. I'm looking forward to my bed now since it was an active day.
