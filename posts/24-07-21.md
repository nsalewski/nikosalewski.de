I didn't work today. I spent time with my family all day. Now I'm tired and will go to bed soon.

On the train, I read _The Art Spirit_ by Robert Henri. I'd like to share a few excerpts with you.

> When the artist is alive in any person, whatever his kind of work may be, he becomes an inventive, searching, daring, self-expressing creature. He becomes interesting to other people. He disturbs, upsets, enlightens, and he opens ways for a better understanding. Where those who are not artists are trying to close the book, he opens it, shows there are still more pages possible.

This speaks to my heart.

> Know what the old masters did. Know how they composed their pictures, but do not fall into the conventions they established. These conventions were right for them, and they are wonderful. They made their language. You make yours. They can help you. All the past can help you.

This reminded me that I really need to make my own language and give my personal touch to everything I do.

> An art student must be a master from the beginning; that is, he must be master of such as he has. By being now master of such as he has there is promise that he will be master in the future.

This made me think about how important it is to master the basics and be a master in them right from the beginning.
