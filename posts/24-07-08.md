I'm trying to become an early riser. I got up at 7 am today and went to bed at 10 pm. Man, this feels like a work day par excellence.

I'll write a few emails now, then get myself some water, have a nice breakfast, and work on my new _Learnground_ landing page. Oh, and I want to buy a new pen because I'm currently writing with a pencil Mohamed lent me.

See you later.

It was a really nice day.
