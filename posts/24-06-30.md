Today was a chill day. It was my grandma's birthday, and I just got back home. I watched the last minutes of the Spain-Georgia game. Earlier, there were some office tasks to be done, like sending the monthly pay to the chess teachers and announcing the lectures for tomorrow. I will chill for the rest of the evening and do nothing. Maybe I'll watch the highlights of the England game, read something, or text with friends. I need to get to bed a bit earlier today so I can make a peaceful walk to the bakery tomorrow morning.

Oh, and I saw that a few students used the toy app and did more exercises on their own! This was a delight to see. One student kept testing the app and wrote me an email saying he found another bug. I implemented it on purpose as a "feature." That's quite funny. But it's so cool to see that people care and man ... I love these kids.

Okay, chill time now.
