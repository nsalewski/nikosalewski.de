Today was a chill day. In the morning, I went for a long walk with a friend. Later, I just chilled. I coded a bit in the afternoon, but not too much.

I was thinking about the concrete concept of personalized learning. In the sense of spending time thinking about an idea until you can add your own touch to it -- making it unique. When I started loving math and physics in the 10th grade, when I was maybe 16, I always kept thinking about the stuff we learned in the lessons afterwards. I would walk out of the classroom and keep thinking and thinking about the concepts. Somehow, they became personal, and I remembered them really well. Thinking deeply about ideas is a beautiful thing.
