> The most important thing a young ball player can learn is that he can’t be good every day.  
> You don’t have to always be amazing. You do always have to show up. What matters is sticking around for the next at bat. The ability to do that, coupled with the ability to endure what John Steinbeck called “dawdly days” while writing East of Eden—those days when everything seems out of whack, when you’re just not feeling it, when the distractions won’t stop—is the first step to greatness.“
