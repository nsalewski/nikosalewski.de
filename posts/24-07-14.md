It's really good to recharge over the weekend. I didn't work too much yesterday and today. I spent my time well, enjoying social activities.

I'm fully motivated for the new week and looking forward to programming tomorrow after finishing some organizational tasks for _chess4u_.

Okay, time to sleep. I need energy for tomorrow.
