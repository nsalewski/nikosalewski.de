I'm pretty tired these days. The _buildspace_ program took quite a bit of energy, and I don't have as much energy as usual. I made the best of it today. Programming can be so unsatisfying, though. I worked three to four hours on a bug and still haven't solved it. What a bummer.

We had a _chess4u_ practice tournament today and I made a nice dinner for myself. Now, I'll do a small workout and then go to bed.

I wanna share a quote from Colin Phelan out of his book _The Local School_ with you.

> A teacher teaches passion to the teached,  
> A teacher teaches to live and love  
> So that life and love may find a home to stay  
> And to grow from one to next and next to all.
