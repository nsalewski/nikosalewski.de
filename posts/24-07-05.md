I'm going to work on _Learnground_ again and finish the _n&w_ program with it. I will find a solution for the _chess4u_ exercise app, but it may not happen in the next three weeks. I started working on a new _Learnground_ site using _Next.js_ and _TypeScript_ for the first time. I can copy a lot of the functions from the earlier version. I will take a different approach and work more closely with people who care about the project.

Germany lost against Spain today, which was quite sad. I need to sleep now and keep working in the morning and noon because I'm busy in the afternoon and evening tomorrow. Good night!
