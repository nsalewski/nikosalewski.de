Today was such a nice day. I had a nice lunch at the local unpackaged store and took it slowly again. I'm getting better at recognizing when I still need to rest and give myself more chill time when needed.

In the evening I went to the football traiing again after a longer break. It was so much fun. I had some pizza for dinner and talked to Mohamed for a while.

Good day. Feeling energized again.
