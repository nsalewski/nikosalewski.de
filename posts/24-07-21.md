I didn't work today. I spent time with my family all day. Now I'm tired and will go to bed soon.

In the train I read _The Art Spirit_ by _Robert Henri_. I want to share a few excerpts with you.

> When the artist is alive in any person, whatever his kind of work may be, he becomes an inventive, searching, daring, self-expressing creature. He becomes interesting to other people. He disturbs, upsets, enlightens, and he opens ways for a better understanding. Where those who are not artists are trying to close the book, he opens it, shows there are still more pages possible.
