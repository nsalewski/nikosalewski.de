> They say each man is an island, and that's what you become if you go looking for things that the people around you aren't looking for. Like a soldier returning from war can't even really fit into civilian life again, you, too, will forever be changed by your private battle for knowledge — even when it's over, you bear the scars for life.

Mir fällt auf, dass ich viel bedachter war, wenn ich mir Mühe gegeben habe schön zu schreiben. Die Schrift ist ordentlicher und ebenso die Gedanken.

> The ego can set up camp anywhere, it is a shape-shifter. If superiority doesn't work, meaninglessness might; if meaninglessness doesn't work, then setting up camp as the disconnected witness might. The ego is constantly in flux. Once you're onto it — once you've discovered it in one aspect of your being — it will disappear, only to reappear somewhere else. It is very cunning, very subtle. In fact, as I see it, the ego's illusion is one of the most impressive forces in all of nature.

> The way humans reckon age is incorrect. Most people stop developing at a very early age. What looks like a seventy-year-old is generally an eleven-year-old with fifty-nine years of experience.
