I'm tired today. I will go to bed now and get some rest. I worked on the new _Learnground_ site, but there is still so much work to be done. Tomorrow, I'm booked from noon until evening, so it won't be easy to get in the hours. Update #3 is due for _n&w s5_, and I have a little bit of time pressure.

I have to get my laundry, make my bed, and then rest. See you tomorrow.
