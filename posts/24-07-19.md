Hi! Today was a long day and it was a good one. I had a nice lunch at _sisu_ with Martin and Kai. I worked on _chess4u_ and _Learnground_. I did two walks and talked to friends and family.

I realized that it is a lot of fun to work on something that helps other people. It's not easy for me to build _Learnground_, and I have to learn so much stuff to make it super safe and reliable, but it's so much fun. And it gets better. I need to put in more hours though to get a usable version very soon. The teachers want to teach!

Best,
Niko
