It's 9:29 pm, and I'm sitting at my desk. I got up early this whole week, and it feels a bit strange but good. Normally, I worked in sprints and worked on stuff for plenty of uninterrupted hours, often neglecting sleep. Having a fixed schedule makes me walk in small steps towards my goals. I don't like not finishing things I've been working on and to delay the process until the next day. But I guess I can get used to it.

It's fun to work on tough problems. Today I spent a few hours on something complex and my mind needed some time to organize the solution. It's a cool sensation. At first, you feel confused and overloaded, but then the pieces sort themselves and the next steps become clearer.

I'm really tired now. I think I'll spend a few minutes reading _Nicolás Gómez Dávila_ and share an aphorism with you.

> Was reifen will, muß der Langeweile mit Gleichmut gegenübertreten.  
> Zivilisationen sind der Abglanz geduldig ertragener Eintönigkeiten.

> Die Frage verstummt nur angesichts der Liebe.  
> "Wozu lieben?" ist die einzige unmögliche Frage.

I hope you speak German or that your translator is attentive.

I also feel quite calm -- like peaceful. That's always a good feeling. I'm looking forward to tomorrow. Okay, okay, sleeping time. Up to the bathroom and then jump into bed. Bye!
