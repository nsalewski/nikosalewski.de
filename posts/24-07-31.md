I did a lot of organizational work for _chess4u_ today. There wasn't much time for programming but I tried solving the CORS problem. It feels like I'm getting closer to the solution but it's still not working.

I went to the gym here earlier. It feels very good to work out. I want to get stronger again and man ... it's also the indie hacker trait to be in shape. I have to fulfill that duty with honor -- just kidding. Going to bed now!
