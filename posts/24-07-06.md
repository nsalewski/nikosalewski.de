I spent a few hours today working on _Learnground_. I created a Facebook group for the parents and the teachers, which I'm the only member of at the moment. I met with a friend from my uni days, and it was so nice. I have to sleep now. Tomorrow, I will keep working on _Learnground_. I have to make it great, and I need to learn a lot more about web development.
