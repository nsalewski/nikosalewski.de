Today was such a nice day. I had a nice lunch at the local unpackaged store and took it slowly again. I'm getting better at recognizing when I still need to rest and give myself more chill time when needed.

In the evening I went to the football training again after a longer break. It was so much fun. I had some pizza for dinner and talked to Mohamed for a while.

Good day. Feeling energized again. I'm going to take a shower now and then go to sleep. Let me share another quote from Colin Phelan's book _The Local School_.

> Sanjit is a teacher; he primarily makes his financial living through his classes. From his ground level apartment under the main overpass of central Kolkata, just a few hundred feet from the bustling seven-way Park Circus intersection, Sanjit lives a quiet life and "watches the world go by." Deeply introspective, Sanjit discovered books at an early age. He slowly discovered, and continues to discover himself through books. Despite his keen social skills, books offer guidance, support, and operate as some of his best friends.

I love his writing, and I can somehow find myself in these lines.
