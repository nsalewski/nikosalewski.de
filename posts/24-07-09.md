Booked in early again today.

I just submitted the week three update for _n&w s5_ in a small speedrun because the deadline was at 8:59 am. Now, I have to keep going and also do some things for _chess4u_.

Today was a really good day. I broke my commit record with 37 commits. Nice. I did my _n&w s5_ update #3 with 30 seconds left on the deadline timer -- that was close. One thing I have to do better tomorrow is getting outside. I spent most of my time from 8 am until 9 pm at the desk. I learned a lot about how to talk to users from the lecture I just watched and that I can gather more data and be a bit more scientific in the building process. Okay, now I will watch the first half of the semi-final match. No idea who's playing, Spain against France maybe? Bye!
