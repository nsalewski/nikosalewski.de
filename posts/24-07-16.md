I watched an open air theatre play this evening with friends. Sometimes you have these quiet revelations, meaning moments in which something inside of you changes. I was watching the play and got quiet inside. I'm dealing with a personal issue, and it's been bothering me quite a bit for a few months now. In this moment I felt peaceful and loosened my grip on the issue somehow. I felt relief.

When you heal from something, people say that it's gradual and that transformative moments are a fairytale, I'm not sure. I have been recovering from something this year and it gets gradually better but there are also these shifts I've noticed after which I feel different.

Today was a really cool day. I went out to have lunch with Martin and got stuff done. Good night!
