Mondays are not always easy. I had a bad night and couldn't sleep. That's why today's morning wasn't great.

I made the best of it. I worked on _Learnground_, fixed a bug there, taught a chess lesson for _chess4u_ and spoke to a friend about a new idea. It was a nice day somehow, even though I didn't win over the morning. Tomorrow will be busy because I need to submit the week four update for _nights & weekends_ by 8:59 am. We can do it!

Okay, time to sleep.
