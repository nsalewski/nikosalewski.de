Today, I worked in the morning and rested for nearly the remaining day. The last weeks have been intense and it was rare that I had time to chill and recover. It's always important to take time out when feeling low on energy, I guess.

I'm listening to [this banger](https://open.spotify.com/intl-de/track/3KSMrtSNtGRM84bb2aSNkX?si=ee22ce38de134eef). This was a song I loved when I was 13 or something.

It's crazy how much changes when you get more experienced. I did a few things over the last few days that would've been big for me a few years ago and now I'm more chilled and more confident.
