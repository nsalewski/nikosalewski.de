Hi. I don't feel so good today. I don't know. I'm doubting myself a lot. I spoke with the guy from the chess exercise system I'm building the app for _n&w_ with, and he wasn't that interested or cooperative. This brought my excitement down. I'm doubting the project. It's difficult today. These damn days.

I tried to implement an algorithm that recognizes chess positions from a chess book. It didn't work too badly but also not great. Nothing was working today, unfortunately. Oh no, that's not true. The football training was nice. And I had a few good conversations. And I got a donut from the bakery. I don't know, man. What to do? Tomorrow will be better. I will watch today's lecture now. Don't know what to say. See you tomorrow.
