I'm gradually getting fitter. Today, I made a bike tour to a birthday party and back, totaling two hours of cycling -- so sporty, Niko!

I wanna quote _The Local School_ again.

> I said to him, in the Hindi we had coincidentally just covered, "mein sas le raha hoon. Mein aram se," or "I am breathing. I am chill." Sanjit turned to me and said, "petrichor, is the name for this."
